    "The Olympics is a time of competition and national pride. People around the world arrive at the Olympics to support their nation's athletes throughout many sporting events. While the olympics are catered around its athletic events and fans, it is also very much about business. Host cities invest into the Olympics heavily in hopes of making sizable gains for both the local and national economy through tourism, marketing, etc. In this analysis, we look at the influence of the Olympics on the host country's international arrival data as well as international expenditure data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the timeline graph outlining the international arrival data for countries that hosted since 2006, we can see that majority of the countries experienced an uptick in their number of international arrivals on the year they hosted aside from China. China's number of international arrivals dropped by 3% compared to the year before. However, there is much needed context to explain this change. Leading up to the 2008 Summer Olympics, there were numerous concerns regarding human rights violation committed by China during the civil unrest in Tibet that led high-profile politicians and celebrities to boycott the games. Additionally, the level of air pollution in Beijing came under scrutiny due to the hazard it posed to the competing athletes and the general public. The financial crisis of 2007-2008 was also a factor since it was a severe worldwide economic crisis limiting an individual's spending ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The international expenditure data, on the other hand, tells us a different story of the macroeconomy during the time of Olympics and the year after. Nations such as Italy, China, Canada, and the United Kingdom experienced an increase in their international expenditures the year they hosted the Olympics as opposed to Russia and Brazil. Russia hosted the Olympics in 2014, a time at which they were experiencing their own financial crisis. Due to the fall in price of oil, a major export of Russia, a sharp devaluation of the Russian ruble took place. Similarily, Brazil also faced an economic crisis in 2015, a year before hosting the Olympics. This occured as a result of a dispute in the legitmacy of the Brazilian elections leading to dissatification with the government by the general public. There were also concerns about the Zika virus that raised fears regarding its potential effect on competing athletes and visitors. "

    "inspired to explore the world. In the following paragraph we shall see if this holds up, and how I worked through the\n",
    "data to find said results.\n",
    "   I’ve learned that cleaning the data, and completely understanding is not only fundamental to analyzing data, but also fascinating. The routes each of us took and branched from to find answers for each of our own questions shows the flexibility and the power of this first crucial step to analyzing any data. I digress, the main highlights, are whittling down the massive olympics data to only have the city, the country, the year, and season of the game for the past hundred years, which is forty-two places. Then by merging left and constricting for the years on when we have information on the number of departures, which results to ten cities from 1995 to 2018. Perfectly, that leaves us with five Winter Olympic Games and five Summer Olympic Games to analyze. To graph some of the data I discovered. I focused one section at looking at all the summer and winter games on their own graphs, and I believe the best way to visualize the changes over time would be a multi line graph to compare the trajectories in a succinct way. The best way is to have the year of each country hosting as the start date and then make the each timeline relative to it’s own growth, so I decided to make this graph focus on the percent change for the next three years to see if there was an increase or decrease in departures. What I found seems to be slightly positive to an increase in departures post hosting the Olympics, however it’s more inconclusive, since the results are generally all over the place without any similar patterns matching up. Which is frustrating, but fair since, the world is a complex place and not everything is going to be so simple for a cause and effect.\n",
    "   The second graph, I decided to focus on one country and see if a linear regression could be insightful to see if the rate of departures changed from pre hosting the Olympics to post. I chose China as the candidate because in just a few months it will be hosting the Olympics again, so it would be fun to see if any the linear regression would still hold true. (Though with the pandemic about, probably not.) I created the linear regressions and found the slope after hosting was three point nine times the rate of departures before hosting the Olympics. This could be a strong result for use to be able to slightly reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "   This increase of international tourism and travel can be from the impact the Olympic Games had on individual people as well as corporations to pursue connections outside of China. As China is one of the booming economies the more business fields the countries companies can partner with the more travel to said countries would most likely follow. That is just one of several reasons why the departure rate increased, still I’m happy that we can reject the null hypothesis in some capacity!"
