    "The Olympics is a time of competition and national pride. People around the world arrive at the Olympics to support their nation's athletes throughout many sporting events. While the olympics are catered around its athletic events and fans, it is also very much about business. Host cities invest into the Olympics heavily in hopes of making sizable gains for both the local and national economy through tourism, marketing, etc. In this analysis, we look at the influence of the Olympics on the host country's international arrival data as well as international expenditure data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the timeline graph outlining the international arrival data for countries that hosted since 2006, we can see that majority of the countries experienced an uptick in their number of international arrivals on the year they hosted aside from China. China's number of international arrivals dropped by 3% compared to the year before. However, there is much needed context to explain this change. Leading up to the 2008 Summer Olympics, there were numerous concerns regarding human rights violation committed by China during the civil unrest in Tibet that led high-profile politicians and celebrities to boycott the games. Additionally, the level of air pollution in Beijing came under scrutiny due to the hazard it posed to the competing athletes and the general public. The financial crisis of 2007-2008 was also a factor since it was a severe worldwide economic crisis limiting an individual's spending ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The international expenditure data, on the other hand, tells us a different story of the macroeconomy during the time of Olympics and the year after. Nations such as Italy, China, Canada, and the United Kingdom experienced an increase in their international expenditures the year they hosted the Olympics as opposed to Russia and Brazil. Russia hosted the Olympics in 2014, a time at which they were experiencing their own financial crisis. Due to the fall in price of oil, a major export of Russia, a sharp devaluation of the Russian ruble took place. Similarily, Brazil also faced an economic crisis in 2015, a year before hosting the Olympics. This occured as a result of a dispute in the legitmacy of the Brazilian elections leading to dissatification with the government by the general public. There were also concerns about the Zika virus that raised fears regarding its potential effect on competing athletes and visitors. "
